# Preface
In previous eras humanity has mastered the machine and built many things that have transformed our world from agrarian societies to industrial powerhouses. We today have the luxury of leveraging computers and emerging technology to help us process data, aid in enhancing the effectiveness of scientific study, and generate tools necessary to actually implement all the knowledge we have accumulated over thousands of years into practical automated methods, a veritable technology revolution brought about by the computer. The theory is that we can use technology to allow everyday people with the opportunity to effortless implement complex scientific conclusions to improve their everyday standard of living. We stand upon the shoulders of giants, the men and women who came before us, The following thesis is meant to honor their work, to faithfully interpret, to be charitable to their arguments, and perhaps realize the dreams they've set forth. In doing such we can carry the torch and pass on the long legacy that is humankind.

Some major contributions in the field of pedagogy, that is learning theories. Come from the work of Gustav Levine and C.J. Burke who authored the book "Mathematical Model Techniques for Learning Theories". In this work the foundations are laid to create mathematical models detailing the process of human learning. On the back of this work allowed such studies as Hermann Ebbinghaus's study now dubbed "The Forgetting Curve", originally done between 1880 and 1885 to be faithfully reproduced, confirmed in 2015 with the same results by Jaap M. J. Murre and Joeri Dros.

Much of the work that is built upon is not my own, and one of the greatest wealth of information on the topic of adult learning and continuing education comes from Peter Jarvis, "Who has died aged 81, was a renowned adult educator and emeritus professor of continuing education at the University of Surry." In the preface of his Book "Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Human Learning" he states "I have written it in the profound hope that it might help others who want to know a little more about teaching and learning: this includes students and teachers, course designers and educational managers, and also policy makers. All that I can hope is that in some ways it may prove useful to those who do me the honour of reading my work." It is my honour to pick up his work, to carry that torch and perhaps one day be able to pass that legacy onwards. Peter is no longer with us, but the contributions he's made to the field allows us to do the work that we now embark on.

## Introduction
Here in western society, from the time we are young until the time we become of legal age, education is our core responsibility. Yet when we graduate high school, education becomes an option rather a mandatory staple of our lives. Is this a failure of superiors? Or the extension of the value of freedom? If education is of the highest virtue, why is it abandoned when we come of age? The concerns to be explored extend from the belief that education is not actually a real priority in our society. For if education was as valued as it would appear, we would be encouraged on a societal level to continue our education into our adulthood and place lifelong learning as a key priority. Much research and much debate already exists in academia, coming from many different viewpoints. It could be said that the onus of educating oneself should not be upon the individual, for that poses great danger to society at large, rather the onus of educating a people should be upon those guardians who have set themselves as shepherds of the people, yet this also can be said to be dangerous. To engage in such a pursuit, we can echo the word's of Immanuel Kant's "What is Enlightenment". Namely that these guardians are not a good thing, that we should be given the intellectual freedom to pursue enlightenment, the use of our own understanding. Yet we come upon a grave issue, if people are given this freedom, then so far restricted in their civil and economic liberties that exercising such freedom becomes implausible then we have failed the very notion that people should think and learn for themselves. So the goal instead becomes how do we model a system that not only gives people the freedom and tools to learn but rather extends the imperative of learning beyond high school and into adulthood.

To properly answer such a monumental issue, I must first breakdown the methodology. We will not be exploring value systems or the hows and whys behind societal change. While we could explore how economic systems restrict people while leaving a "freedom of indifference" intact, or we could explore how systems of government impact our education, such topics deserve a discussion unto themselves. Instead my concern tends itself towards the physical nature of the mind, what factors help or hinder the learning process, and how such processes of the brain can be mathematically modeled so we might be able to act upon them with the same scientific rigor that took us to the Moon and later to Mars. With this we can build the tools necessary to enable us to effectively pursue education not only in our youth, but well into our adulthood and into our senior years.

A few targeted questions can help us create a theory of learning that can be acted upon in a systematic way by future institutions. How do ideas relate to each other? How do we learn things, and how can we foster retention of that information? What determines whether a question fosters better understanding? Given an idea, what determines what is required to understand that idea? So how do we model and map the answers to develop a form a grand unified theory of human learning in order to create a streamlined education process?

Before we continue it is important to clarify the scope a little further, that is the concern that nuance of human condition might in some way invalidate all research. That is neurological disorders and children. "we should not seek to regard children's learning, for example, as necessarily different from adult learning - even though there may be different processes and it occurs in different social contexts." (Peter Jarvis, 2005). Further we could conclude by extension that the learning of neurodivergent individuals are not necessarily different than neurotypical individuals. While processes differ from person to person, the underlying fundamentals are the same. With this assurance we build a bedrock for implementing learning techniques knowing that they are compatible with all human life.

## Building a model
The beginnings of this work started with my own frustrations as an adult student, 10 years out of high school. I spent my first semester mastering the material for all of my classes, and while I did extremely well in my coursework, coming into the second semester I found that I had forgotten nearly everything I worked so hard to retain. I'm a computer scientist, I solve problems, and I came to university to learn and learn how to solve problems better, to reason, to think critically. So here we have a problem that is known to us all; Forgetting. So while browsing through many videos attempting to learn a better method, I heard about Hermann Ebbinghaus a German psychologist who laid the foundation for experimental studies in memory. He modeled how we forget over time, and with the study being confirmed in 2015, I knew I had something reputable to work with. We have a half-life to our memory, and every time we review that knowledge the half-life of our memory grows longer. Using the basics of Python programming I developed an initial first draft of a program that allowed me to enter my class material in the form of questions and then, using the mathematical formula that Ebbinghaus discovered, create a revision schedule for each question so that the information is presented to me for review when I am on the cusp of forgetting that information. In this manner I have created an automaton that does the hard work of implementation, allowing me simply to use the tool as designed. We now can build software that enables us to learn faster and more effectively.

Every interaction with another human being usually involves some form of question. Questions have become our primary means of gathering information, without them learning breaks down. Without a question you are never prompted to retrieve information, and when information is not retrieved and utilized your brain is designed to forget it. We could conclude that simply setting up a simple spaced repitition schedule for learning is not sufficient in and of itself. We need to input high quality questions into our learning process in addition to properly spacing them.

Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence gives us the capability to process human language as input into a computer program. The origins of Natural Language Processing (NLP) come from the 1940's with the term Artificial Intelligence first being coined in the early 1950's with Alan Turing's "the Imitation game". As of 2024, AI has reached a point that allows us to easily process billions of pages of text. Using this technology allows us to automate the next part of human learning, generating quality questions which enhance the encoding process of memory and the subsequent retrieval of our memory.  It my hope that effectively designing AI and NLP to read text and notes; questions may be generated which better challenge the user's understanding of the material. Most of our time spent reading academic text is to gather information not necessarily to learn it., and since it already known that AI can read and gather information much faster than humans, we can use AI to do heavy work of gathering information from dense academic literature. With such a tool in place we would be able to focus our effort on learning the material instead of compiling already compiled information into notebooks and documents.

Next, we need to evaluate the user themselves. It is not enough to simply write good questions and space them effectively. In Education we have come up with terms like "no child left behind", that children "learn at their own pace". Yet, metaphysically we are all human, and the same basic cognitive processes guide us all, however there is a difference in degree and performance between humans. So such a system needs to account for the individuals capacity for learning, Cognitive Load Theory is the framework we will use to effectively evaluate this. "Cognitive Load Theory describes memory as having three main parts: sensory, working, and long-term. Cognitive load is divided up into three types, intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Cognitive overload occurs when the combination of intrinsic, extraneous and germane loads becomes overwhelming for the learner." (mcw.edu) Scientists have found a way to effectively measure cognitive load as well. This part of the model is designed around this theory, that we should only present as much information as the user is capable of. This solution effectively solves burnout while maintaining long-term performance. We do not need to push ourselves over the edge in order to be highly effective learners.

One last element to this model is the connection of ideas, by asking "What makes something memorable?" we can explore how to leverage Cognitive Load Theory to make learning effortless. Some information sticks in our mind effortlessly, while yet other information refuses to stay put. It is unclear how exactly to proceed at this moment in time, but it seems plausible that a well constructed AI model will be able to process large volumes of academic text and create a graphical map of how concepts relate to one another. Using this map we can see what information will be most easily absorbed next by the user. The software would then be able to effectively build a lesson plain tailor fit to the user.

The last part of our model needs to allow for the implementation of the scientific method. Experimentation requires we gather data, and thankfully the internet gives us access to over five billion people worldwide. The software is free and opensource on https://github.com/flerbnerp, allowing anyone and everyone to simply download and use the product free of charge. This allows us to get a very large user base. Gathering user data regarding the effectiveness of the automated processes, gives us quick and fast feedback on what does and doesn't work. If a large enough user base is attained then we can avoid unrepresentative sampling in the work. While I have personally found the first iteration of the software to be highly effective for myself, it unclear as to whether or not such a tool would be useful for others in its current state. By building in functionality that sends user usage data back to the development team we can have scientific data to back up our claims and make such tools more effective for those who will come after us.
